# VirtualTrack
This is a computer simulated race track for ISE 2100 Data Management and Display course project at Ohio University. 
The results are generated based on actual track times from hotwheels cars on a track.
The track design is inspired by the sample project from [Javascript Animation Workshop](https://github.com/KokoDoko/JS-Animation-Workshop) by [KokoDoko](https://github.com/KokoDoko).
Animations are made using [Greensock](https://www.greensock.com/) library.
